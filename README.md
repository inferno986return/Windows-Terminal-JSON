# Windows-Terminal-JSON
My Windows Terminal JSON

To standardise my Windows Terminal settings across my computers and share my changes that I made, I have publically released my settings.json file.

In the old days of Windows Terminal this was the only way to change the appearance of Windows Terminal until the settings tab arrived. I still find the settings.json file superior for making alterations.

You will need a copy of JetBrains Mono. It's my preferred monospaced font (though Clincher Mono from the Microsoft Store is decent too) and therefore superior to the default Cascadia Code and Consolas fonts: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/

## What has changed

* I like my font size nice and big.
* I insist on the default PowerShell blue background (hex: #012456) 

## How to install

1. Copy the style alterations from this JSON to your own (I don't think overwriting works because of the GUIDs for each shell).
2. Load up Windows Terminal.
3. Use a text editor such as Visual Studio Code (which I prefer) or Atom to make alterations.
